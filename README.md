# Javascript Crash Course

## Introduction

Javascript is important because it is the language of the web browser. And with the rapidly growing popularity of Node.js, it has a growing relevance in server environments as well. But it has been said that Javascript is _“the world's most misunderstood programming language”_.

Almost every professional software developer will need to write Javascript code at some point in time. This class will help the novice and even experienced Javascript programmer become familiar with the good, the bad, and the ugly of the Javascript language.

We will cover Javascript grammar, objects, functions, inheritance, arrays, scope, closures and more while focusing on practical applications and pointing out pitfalls and warnings.

> Javascript “...is a language with enormous expressive power. It is even better when you know what you're doing.”  - Douglas Crockford

## Stuff You Need

We will be using a handy tool called **JS Bin** during class. If you have an active internet connection, you may access **JS Bin** simply by browsing to [http://www.jsbin.com](http://www.jsbin.com).

(If you wish to install a local version of **JS Bin**, you may do so by following the instructions located [here](http://jsbin.com/help/running-a-local-copy-of-jsbin).)
